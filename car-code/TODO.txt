software:
- allow client to reconnect to vision server
- for some reason launch_servers.bat doesn't print out anything from the drive server even though it does print out stuff from the vision server

hardware:
- figure out wtf is up with depth and rgb not working at the same time
	probably because undervolting, test with old pi
- move wires so kinect can actually tilt
